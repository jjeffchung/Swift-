# Swift-
A collection of my personal Swift projects and assignments from my iPhone Application Programming Certification Program at City College of San Francisco.

1) Click Count program 
- Enables the user to increment, decrement, clear and reset the counter label with respective UI buttons.

2) Choose Your Own Adventure program 
- Enables the user to progress through a short story with different choices enabled via 2 UI buttons on each ViewController. The app also makes use of a navigation controller. 

3) Scientific Calculator program 
- A calculator app which features the Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Decimal, Square Root and Percentage calculation operations. Additionally, there is a Clear button to enable the user to delete the last entered digit on screen, as well as an All Clear button to delete everything.  

4) Planet and Sun in your palm: Augmented Reality(AR) program
- An AR program which uses the AR Kit and showcases an Earth and Sun objects into the user's environment. 

5) Rock Paper Scissors (RPS) iOS game 

- An RPS game which lets the user play against the computer while keeping track of the Game's History with the user's Win and Loses. 

6) Photo Album App

- A Photo Album app which I did while following an online tutorial and then added some additional features and edits on my own. The app needs the user's permission to access the Photo Library to display the on-device's images. The user can swipe up or down to go through the pictures and to double tap with two fingers to zoom in and out.
